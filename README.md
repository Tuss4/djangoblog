a simple django blog

This was a speed project. I wanted to see if I could build a blog from scratch in a few hours. I did. And I deployed it to heroku. http://fathomless-cove-1323.herokuapp.com :)

How does it work? Use the admin console to write a post and it will display it in the views.

Features to add: 
- Layout
- Pagination
- Navigation XD
